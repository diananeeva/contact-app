# Contact Manager Application

This is a simple **React** application for managing contacts. The application allows users to:
- Add new contacts.
- View a list of contacts.
- Delete contacts.
- Data is persisted using **Local Storage**, so your contacts will remain even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- **Add Contacts**: Users can add new contacts by providing a name and email address.
- **Delete Contacts**: Users can remove contacts from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Contacts are saved in the browser's local storage to persist data across sessions.
- **Basic Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before adding a contact.
